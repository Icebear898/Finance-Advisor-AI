## 📊 Production Deployment

For production deployment:

1. **Backend**: Use Gunicorn with Uvicorn workers
2. **Frontend**: Build with `npm run build` and serve with a web server
3. **Database**: Consider using a production vector database like Pinecone
4. **Environment**: Set `DEBUG=False` and configure production settings

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Port already in use**:
   ```bash
   # Kill processes using ports 8000 or 3000
   lsof -ti:8000 | xargs kill -9
   lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9
   ```

2. **API key errors**:
   - Check that your API keys are correctly set in `backend/.env`
   - Ensure the keys have proper permissions

3. **Import errors**:
   - Make sure all dependencies are installed: `pip install -r backend/requirements.txt`
   - For frontend: `npm install` in the frontend directory

4. **Document upload issues**:
   - Check that the `backend/data/documents` directory exists
   - Ensure file size is within limits (10MB default)
